# Spec-Driven Development with Neovim

A comprehensive workflow for implementing features using specification-driven development with Claude AI integration.

## Overview

This system is inspired by Kiro's spec-driven development approach with automation hooks, enabling you to:
1. Create detailed feature specifications
2. Generate implementation tasks from specs using Claude
3. Generate code from individual tasks using Claude
4. Automatically run linting and testing on save
5. Track progress through integrated tools

## Key Bindings

### Feature Management
- `<leader>wnf` - Create new feature (interactive form)
- `<leader>wnj` - Create feature from Jira ticket
- `<leader>woa` - Open all feature files in tabs
- `<leader>wos` - Open feature spec.md
- `<leader>wot` - Open feature tasks.md
- `<leader>wod` - Open feature design.md

### Claude Integration
- `<leader>wgt` - Generate tasks from spec (spec → tasks)
- `<leader>wgc` - Generate code from current task (task → code)

### Testing
- `<leader>trt` - Run nearest test
- `<leader>trf` - Run current file tests
- `<leader>tra` - Run all tests
- `<leader>trs` - Toggle test summary
- `<leader>tro` - Open test output

### Formatting
- `<leader>cf` - Format current buffer

## Commands

- `:CreateFeature [name] [description]` - Create new feature structure with optional description
- `:CreateFeature [description]` - Generate feature name from description (if not dasherized)
- `:CreateFeature` - Open interactive feature creation form
- `:CreateFeatureFromJira` - Create feature from Jira ticket
- `:SpecToTasks` - Generate tasks from current spec
- `:TaskToCode` - Generate code from current task
- `:OpenFeature` - Open all feature files

## Workflow

### 1. Create Feature

#### From Jira Ticket
```bash
# Create feature from Jira ticket (automatically detects ticket from branch name)
<leader>sfj
# Or command: :CreateFeatureFromJira
```

**Jira Integration Features:**
- Automatically detects Jira ticket number from current git branch (e.g., `feature/ABC-123-user-auth` → `ABC-123`)
- Prompts for ticket number if not detected
- Opens Claude CLI to generate comprehensive spec from Jira ticket details
- Creates feature directory using ticket number as feature name
- You provide Jira ticket details to Claude, which creates a detailed specification

#### Manual Feature Creation
```bash
# Interactive form (recommended)
<leader>sfn
# Or command: :CreateFeature

# Auto-generate feature name from description
:CreateFeature "Add user authentication with email verification and password reset"
# → Generates feature name like "user-authentication"

# Command line with explicit name and description
:CreateFeature user-authentication "Implement secure user login and registration with email verification"

# Simple command line
:CreateFeature user-authentication
```

**Smart Feature Name Generation:**
- If first argument is not dasherized (contains no hyphens), treats it as description
- Uses Claude to generate appropriate kebab-case feature name
- Works with both command line and interactive form

**Interactive Form:**
- Opens a floating window with form fields
- Enter feature name and multi-line description
- Leave name empty to auto-generate from description
- Press `<C-s>` to create or `<Esc>` to cancel
- If description provided, Claude generates detailed spec

This creates:
- `features/user-authentication/spec.md` - Feature specification (generated from description)
- `features/user-authentication/tasks.md` - Empty tasks file
- `features/user-authentication/design.md` - Empty design file

### 2. Write Specification
If you used the interactive form with a description, the spec is automatically generated by Claude! 

Otherwise, edit `spec.md` with:
- Overview of the feature
- Detailed requirements
- Acceptance criteria
- Technical notes
- Dependencies

### 3. Generate Tasks
With `spec.md` open, press `<leader>sst` to generate `tasks.md` from the specification using Claude.

### 4. Implement Tasks
1. Open `tasks.md`
2. Position cursor on any task line
3. Press `<leader>stc` to generate code for that task
4. Choose file extension (rb, js, ts, py)
5. Claude generates implementation code

### 5. Auto-Testing & Linting
When you save any source file (`.rb`, `.js`, `.ts`, `.py`):
- Automatic linting runs
- Tests run in background
- Results displayed in status line

## Setup Requirements

### Claude CLI Setup
```bash
# Install Claude CLI (if not already installed)
# Follow instructions at: https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code

# Authenticate with Claude
claude auth login

# No environment variables needed - CLI handles authentication
```

### Jira API Setup (for StartWork command)
```bash
# Set up Jira credentials securely using environment variables

# For Bash/Zsh:
source ~/.dotfiles/_setup/setup-jira-env

# For Fish shell:
source ~/.dotfiles/_setup/setup-jira-env.fish

# OR set manually:
# Bash/Zsh:
export JIRA_BASE_URL="https://your-company.atlassian.net"
export JIRA_EMAIL="your-email@company.com"
export JIRA_API_TOKEN="your-api-token"

# Fish:
set -gx JIRA_BASE_URL "https://your-company.atlassian.net"
set -gx JIRA_EMAIL "your-email@company.com"
set -gx JIRA_API_TOKEN "your-api-token"

# Create API token at: https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens
```

**Security Best Practices:**
- ✅ **Environment variables** - Credentials stored securely outside code
- ✅ **No git commits** - Never commit tokens to repositories  
- ✅ **Session-based** - Variables only exist in current shell session
- ✅ **Optional persistence** - Add to shell config for permanent access:
  - **Bash/Zsh**: Add to `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`
  - **Fish**: Add to `~/.config/fish/config.fish`

### Dependencies
Install language-specific tools:

```bash
# Ruby
gem install rubocop rspec

# JavaScript/TypeScript
npm install -g eslint prettier jest

# Python
pip install flake8 black isort pytest
```

## Configuration

The system is configured in `lua/plugins/spec-driven-dev.lua`:

```lua
-- Custom configuration options
spec_driven.setup({
  features_dir = "features",        -- Directory for features
  
  linters = {
    ruby = "bundle exec rubocop",
    javascript = "npx eslint",
    typescript = "npx eslint",
    python = "flake8",
  },
  
  test_runners = {
    ruby = "bundle exec rspec",
    javascript = "npm test",
    typescript = "npm test", 
    python = "pytest",
  },
  
  claude_model = "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
})
```

## Claude Prompting Tips

### For Spec-to-Tasks
Claude is prompted with:
- The complete feature specification
- Instructions to create actionable, ordered tasks
- Request for markdown checkbox format
- Emphasis on measurable, specific tasks

### For Task-to-Code
Claude receives:
- The current task being implemented
- The complete feature specification
- All generated tasks for context
- Any existing code in the target file
- Instructions for clean, production-ready code

### Best Practices
1. **Detailed Specs**: More detailed specs generate better tasks
2. **Clear Tasks**: Specific tasks generate better code
3. **Iterative Approach**: Generate code for one task at a time
4. **Review Generated Code**: Always review and refine generated code
5. **Update Tasks**: Mark tasks as complete and add new ones as needed

## Automation Features

### Auto-Save
- Automatically saves when switching between feature files
- Prevents losing work during rapid context switching

### Auto-Format
- Formats code on save using language-specific formatters
- Organizes tasks.md (moves completed items to bottom)

### Auto-Test
- Runs tests in background when saving source files
- Displays test results in status line
- Only runs for files in `features/` directory

### Visual Indicators
- Highlights TODO/FIXME/NOTE comments in markdown files
- Shows current feature name in status line
- Test status indicators in gutter

## Troubleshooting

### Claude Integration Issues
1. Check internet connection
2. Try reducing spec/task complexity

### Test Runner Issues
1. Verify test commands are correct for your project
2. Check that test files exist and are properly named
3. Ensure dependencies are installed

### Linting Issues
1. Install language-specific linters
2. Configure linter rules in project config files
3. Check file paths and permissions
